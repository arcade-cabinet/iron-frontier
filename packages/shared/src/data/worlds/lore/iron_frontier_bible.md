## The World: The Territories

The year is 1887 in an alternate America where steam technology advanced faster than our timeline. The **Iron Frontier** is the bleeding edge of civilization - where the great railroad companies push ever westward, and fortune-seekers follow in their wake.

### The Central Conflict

**The Iron Valley Railroad Company (IVRC)** controls everything. They own the tracks, the telegraph lines, the water rights. Towns live and die by whether the railroad decides to build a station there.

But the frontier is vast, and IVRC's grip weakens the further you get from the rails. Out in the badlands, the **Copperhead Gang** runs their own empire of stolen payroll and dynamited bridges. In the mountains, independent **Freeminers** resist IVRC's mining monopoly. And rumors persist of a hidden **Automaton Army** - steam-powered soldiers left over from the Civil War, rusting in a forgotten canyon.

### The Protagonist

The player is a **drifter** - arrived on the last train into Dusty Springs with nothing but the clothes on their back and a mysterious letter summoning them to "claim what's rightfully yours" at an address that doesn't exist. The letter is signed only with a gear symbol.

## Tone Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Terse, evocative (Cormac McCarthy meets steampunk)
- Show don't tell
- Let silence speak
- Western idioms, but not parody
- Steam technology is wondrous but dangerous

### Sample Dialogue

**Sheriff Cole**: "Thorne's men came through yesterday. Asked about you by name. I told 'em I ain't seen no drifter matching that description. But they'll be back. They always come back."

**Diamondback Dolores**: "You think we're the villains? We rob trains. IVRC robs lives. Every man in those mountains works sixteen hours breathing copper dust, and when they cough blood, Thorne's doctors say it's 'miner's constitution.' Who's the criminal?"

**The Foreman** (automaton): "ORDERS-RECEIVED... DATED... EIGHTEEN... SIXTY... FOUR... DEFEND... THE... UNION... IDENTIFY... COMBATANT... STATUS..."

## Visual Touchstones

- Red Dead Redemption's landscapes
- Westworld's blend of western and technology
- Deadwood's gritty authenticity
- BioShock Infinite's steampunk aesthetic
- Fallout's retro-futurism applied to 1880s

---

## Audio Touchstones

- Ennio Morricone (spaghetti western tension)
- Nick Cave & Warren Ellis (grit and soul)
- Steam hisses, telegraph clicks, distant train whistles
- Wind through canyons, creaking wood, spurs jingling
