# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Many mobile RPGs feel "soulless"—either generic gacha cash-grabs or clunky ports of PC games with poor touch controls. They lack atmosphere and tangible world-building.

## Solution

Iron Frontier aims to restore the "soul" of exploration-focused RPGs by:

1. **Focusing on Atmosphere**: Using lighting, fog, and sound to create immersion.
2. **Respecting Mobile**: Designing UI and controls specifically for small touch screens.
3. **Procedural Depth**: Using seeded generation to create infinite but meaningful content (not just random noise).

## User Experience Timeline

- **0-30 Seconds (Hook)**:
  - Beautiful splash screen.
  - Immediate drop into gameplay (no long tutorials).
  - First "wow" moment with the diorama view.

- **5 Minutes (Engagement)**:
  - Intuitive movement (tap to go).
  - First loot drop (satisfying feedback).
  - Clear short-term objective ("Talk to the Sheriff").

- **20 Minutes (Retention)**:
  - Level up and stat increase.
  - Exploration of a new biome (visual variety).
  - Discovery of a mystery or deeper quest chain.
