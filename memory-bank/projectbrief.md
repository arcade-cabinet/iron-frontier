# Project Brief

Iron Frontier is a **hand-crafted 3-hour steampunk Western epic RPG** built with Unity 6. Every quest, character, and encounter is deliberately designed to create a focused, narrative-driven experience.

## Creative Vision

A mysterious stranger arrives at the frontier as a railroad conspiracy threatens to tear apart the Old West. Steam-powered machines, corrupt corporations, and fanatical preachers collide in a tale of justice, betrayal, and redemption.

**NOT a procedurally-generated roguelike.** This is a curated, authored experience with:
- **10 main quests** forming a 3-act story (~2.5-3 hours)
- **15 side quests** that enrich the world and provide optional content
- **12 major NPCs** with fully-written dialogue trees
- **5 factions** with interlocking reputation systems
- **Multiple endings** based on player choices

## Core Pillars

1. **Hand-Crafted Narrative**: Every quest, dialogue line, and encounter is authored by design, not generated. Quality over quantity.
2. **Steampunk Frontier Aesthetic**: A unique blend of the Wild West and industrial steam technology (brass, gears, automatons, railroad conspiracy).
3. **Diorama Presentation**: The world renders as a tangible, tilt-shift tabletop diorama with atmospheric lighting and fog.
4. **Meaningful Choices**: Faction reputation, ally relationships, and story branches create real consequences.
5. **Focused Experience**: Designed for 3 hours of play. No padding, no grinding, no filler.
