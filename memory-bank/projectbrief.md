# Project Brief

Iron Frontier is a **mobile-first isometric RPG** set in a Steampunk American Frontier. It combines the atmospheric charm of classic PS1-era RPGs (like Final Fantasy VII) with modern procedural generation and intuitive touch controls.

## Core Pillars

1. **Steampunk Frontier Aesthetic**: A unique blend of the Wild West and industrial steam technology (brass, gears, steam).
2. **Diorama Presentation**: The world renders as a tangible, tilt-shift tabletop diorama, distinct from grid-based tile games.
3. **Touch-First Design**: Controls are designed for thumbs, not mouse cursors. "Tap to move" and "virtual joystick" options.
4. **"One More Minute" Loop**: Gameplay is designed for short bursts (30s to 5m) with frequent rewards and clear objectives.

## Goals

- Create a visually distinct mobile RPG that feels "premium" and "hand-crafted" despite procedural elements.
- Ensure 60fps performance on mobile devices via Babylon.js optimizations.
- Implement a robust persistence layer (SQLite) for complex world state.
