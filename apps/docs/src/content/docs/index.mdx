## What is Iron Frontier?

Iron Frontier is a **mobile-first isometric RPG** that combines the atmospheric charm of classic PS1-era RPGs with modern procedural generation and intuitive touch controls. Set in a unique **Steampunk American Frontier** world, the game features brass gears, steam-powered machinery, and the dusty trails of the Old West.
